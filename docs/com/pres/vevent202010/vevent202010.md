## CNTT RC1 Field Trial


### Orange CNTT RC1 Field Trial

- helped detecting a couple of issues in CNTT RC1
- integrated cinder backup and nova instance_password in Orange IaaS
- to fix 10 remaining single test failures (out 2000+ functional tests, 3 hours
  benchmarking and 3 VNFs automatically onboarded and tested)
- to enhance Functest juju_epc to pass proxies

**99,999%**


### Orange CNTT RC1 feedbacks

- we easily executed the CNTT RC1 playbook asis and no clear bug was found in
  CNTT RC1 Baldy
- CNTT RC1 is now used in our Orange IaaS verification in addition to the
  classical Functest containers
- CNTT RC1 is also executed to verify all deployments before onboarding any VNF
- CNTT RC1 Baldy and CNTT RC2 Baraque are listed in **Orange RFP requirements**
  (see last ONES
  [[1]](http://testresults.opnfv.org/functest/ONES2020NA_OPNFV-CNTT_RFP.1080p.mp4))



## What else?


### Wish list

- to integrate **more benchmarks** in CNTT conformance (e.g. disk benchmarking)
- to switch from the current Kubernetes interoperability testing to a **true**
  CNTT conformance suite
- to build the first **VNF and CNF** conformance suites (**high priority**)

**We need your contribution helps!

### New Functest opportunities

- to implement live monitoring of your OpenStack and Kubernetes deployments via
  a subset of Functest (healthcheck? new Rally tasks?)
- to implement new functest testcases to validate and verify OpenStack upgrades
  (new Rally tasks)?
