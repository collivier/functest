## CNTT RC status


### Functest SUTs

- ease verifying automatically the CNTT-related containers (5 SUTs in total)
- mostly conformed with OpenStack reference implementations except:
  - all use Ceph and Ceph RadosGW
  - one SUT leverages on OVN to check RA1 Chapter5 vs SDN Controllers
- OpenStack and Kubernetes are not redeployed between 2 runs as opposed to
  [CNTT RI](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/cntt/job/cntt-latest-daily/102/)

**Functest SUTs are compliant to CNTT RC**


### RC verification vs Neutron

- all branches are successful vs Neutron reference implementation:
  - [Functest Hunter (Rocky)](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-hunter-daily/485/)
  - [Functest Iruya (Stein)](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-iruya-daily/452/)
  - [Functest Jerma (Train)](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-jerma-daily/249/)
  - [Functest Master (next Ussuri)](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-latest-daily/597/)


### RC verification vs OVN

- the overall results are in a good shape as Functest master includes all latest software:
  - [CNTT Conformance passed sucessfully](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-ovn-latest-daily/17/)
  - [IaaS verification](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-ovn-latest-daily/17/)
    failed due to one Rally task hanging iteration (under analysis)

**RA1 Chapter 5 is compatible with external SDN controllers**



## Field trial results


### Orange IaaS

- Orange IaaS verification has leveraged on the Functest containers before CNTT
- Functest containers are also executed to verify the deployment before any VNF
  onboarding
- a few mandatory features are missing to fully pass CNTT Compliance
  ([cinder backup](https://cntt-n.github.io/CNTT/doc/ref_arch/openstack/chapters/chapter05.html)
  and [keystone security_compliance](https://cntt-n.github.io/CNTT/doc/ref_arch/openstack/chapters/chapter05.html))
- a few extra RadosGW configurations are needed

**the CNTT Conformance is in a good shape**



## What's next?


### last minute's changes:

- tempest_heat was recently added in Functest IaaS verification and will be
  tuned for CNTT compliance
- tempest_horizon should be added into CNTT RC document (mandatory features)

**they would be added into CNTT RC very soon**


### and beyond

- NFVBench and VSperf are being xtesting-ready and should be added in RC
- a few CNTT issues are opened for developping Functest and then RC:
  - [Run fio or dd in Functest](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/issues/1477)
  - [Add ceph bench and rbd bench into Functest](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/issues/1476)
  - [Add swift-bench in Functest](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/issues/1474)

**[help is needed!](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Acntt-n%2FCNTT%2F4)**



## Conclusion


### Take aways

- CNTT RC1 1.0 seems good and stable
- [RA1 Chapter 5]((https://cntt-n.github.io/CNTT/doc/ref_arch/openstack/chapters/chapter05.html)
  is compatible with external SDN controllers
- Orange IaaS is closed to be compliant

**any contribution and RC results are more than welcome!**



## Thank you
